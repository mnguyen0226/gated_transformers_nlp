""" 
Build a seq2seq model:

ENCODER:
- The encoder is similar to the previous one with the multi-layer LSTM swapped for a single-layer GRU.
- Note: don't pass dropout to GRU since dropout is used between each layer of a multilayered RNN
- GRU only requires and returns a hidden state, no cell state
    GRU has number of gating mechanism that control the info flow in and out in the hidden state (similar as LSTM)
    The hidden state takes in the same vector, 
DECODER: 
- GRU takes in the embedded target token, the previous hidden state, and the context vectore
- We will be using the same context vector
- These changes reduce the info compression since the decoder hidden state no longer need to contain info about the source sequence as it is always avaialble as input. 
    Thus it only need to contain info about what tokens it has generated so far
    It is impossible to determine how the model actually use the info provided to it.
