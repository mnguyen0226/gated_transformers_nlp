Note 1: sequence to sequence learning with nn
- Cover the basic workflow of pytorch with torchtext seq2seq.
- The seq2seq will use encode-decider model
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215
- This use multi-layer LSTMs

Note 2: learning phrase representations using rnn encoder-decoder for statistical machine translation
- Imrpove the result.
- Use GRU
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1078

Note 3: Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Aligbn and Tranlate
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473
- Solve the problem of info compression by allowing the decoder to look back at the input sentenceby creating context vectors that are weighed sums of the encoder hidden states. 
- The weigh ted sum are calculated via attention mechanism where the decoder learns to pay attention to more relevant words in te input sentences

Note 4: Packed Padded Sequences, Masking, Inference and BLUE
- Improve the previous medl architecture by adding packed padded sequences and masking
- packed padded sequences allo us to only process the non-padded elements  of our input sentence with out RNN
- Masking is used to force the model to ignore ccertain elements we do not want it to look at, such as attention over padded elements => Small boost
- Also show how to calculate the BLEU metric from out translation

Note 5: Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learning:
- Not using RNN based model bu fuly convolutional
- Meaning that before a word is processed by RNN, all previous words must be processed
- Convolutionssl models can be fulley parallized  which allow them to br trained much quickers
- paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03122
- the Convolutional Sequence to sequence model use multiple convolutional layers in bot h encoder and decoder with attention mechanism between them

Note 6: Attention is all you need
- Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762
- implement the Transfomer, which is based soley on attention mechanisms and introduces Mult-head atention.
The encoder and decoder are made of multiple layer, with each layer consisting of Multihead attention and Positionwise Feedforward sublayers.
- This model is currently used in many state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence and transfer learning tasks.
